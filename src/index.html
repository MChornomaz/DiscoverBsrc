                    As far as we know, our world is unique in the universe, defined by three elements, Air, Land and
                    Water. Each element has
                    its own special properties and phenomena and is home to myriad lifeforms that have infiltrated every
                    habitat, from the
                    deepest oceans to the tiniest nooks and crannies.

                            Hills are landforms that rise above the surrounding terrain and have relatively confined
                            summits but are generally
                            understood to be smaller than mountains. There is no formal distinction between the two.

                            and regolith covering the
                            hill, a process known as downhill creep.
